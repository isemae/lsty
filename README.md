### No More Messy Download Folder!


Organize your directory and simplify your file management.

"lusty" manages folders with source-keyword-target triplets. Each source path corresponds to a shell path when its keyword-target pair is added.
Your current shell path will always be one of the source paths, so you don't have to bother inputting paths. 

Just command, keyword, one target path(if you need).



## Commands


```shell
# Adds a new keyword-target directory pair.
lsty add(-a) keyword /target_dir

# You can use any words for keywords, and file extensions too, such as .hwp, .alz, .egg...
```

```shell
# Removes the pair associated with the specified keyword.
lety del(-d) <keyword>
```

```shell
# Moves all entries with <keyword> in their names.
lsty move(-m) <keyword>
# Moves all entries from a source path to each respective target path.
     move(-m)
# Or you can just move all the entries that is in the data.
     move -A
```
